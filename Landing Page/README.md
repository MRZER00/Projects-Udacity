## Introduction
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project is to create a multi-section landing page, with a dynamic navigation menu dependent on the amount of content added to the page and improve the user experience.

## Explain
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Since we don't know how much content will be added to the page through CMS or API.
We did the following :
* add content to the page dynamically.
* Create navigation menu dynamically.
* All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
* Improves user experience by :
    * when a section is in the viewport, Add an active state to navigation bar items.
    * When the user clicks on the navigation item, the item is scrolled to the appropriate section.
    * Create a button to go to the top of the page and appear after scrolling down a bit (600px) from the screen top.
    * Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling after 4 seconds and appear with just a swipe.
